# 🔥 Forest Fire Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **Linear Regression**, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to predict forest fire burn area based on environmental and meteorological data. The dataset includes features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, which are key contributors to forest fires.

## 📌 Project Overview

Forest fires are one of the most common natural disasters that have devastating effects on the environment and biodiversity. This project aims to **predict the area affected by forest fires** using **Linear Regression**, thereby enabling better preparedness and resource allocation.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Name**: Forest Fires Dataset  
- **Attributes**:
  - `X`, `Y` — spatial coordinates
  - `month`, `day` — time of the year
  - `FFMC`, `DMC`, `DC`, `ISI` — fire weather indexes
  - `temp` — temperature in Celsius

## 📊 Objective

To build a **Linear Regression** model that:
- Takes in the environmental conditions as inputs.
- Outputs the **predicted burn area** of the forest.
